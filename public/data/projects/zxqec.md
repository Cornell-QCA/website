The ZX Calculus provides a universal graphical language for quantum circuits that leverages tensor networks. While the ZX Calculus provides a simple framework, much of Quantum Error Correction revolves around long-range connections that are impractical to implement. Our project leverages the ZX Calculus to render non-local error corrections schemes in a local, implementable, form.
