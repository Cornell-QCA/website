Topological Quantum Computing (TQC) is an exciting subfield of Quantum Computing
which may enable fault-tolerant quantum computation on the hardware level. In
order to explore TQC, our team developed a simulator to learn more about anyons
(the particles which enable TQC) and implement anyonic interaction principles.
