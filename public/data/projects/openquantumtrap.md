We are designing and fabricating a magneto-optical trap for the suspension and manipulation of rubidium atoms by utilizing external-cavity diode laser cooling and ultra-high vacuum chambers. With the help of OpenQuantum, an open source platform that makes quantum hardware engineering more accessible, our goal is to be the first undergraduate team to implement quantum operations on trapped ultracold atoms.
