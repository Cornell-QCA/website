The Quantum Computing Association at Cornell University (QCA) is an
undergraduate student organization that provides opportunities in quantum
computing.  We conduct an introductory series of lectures on quantum computing
open to the public, and we pursue research projects with active project members.
Additionally, we facilitate collaboration between other universities interested
in quantum computing, and are proud members of the [Quantum Coalition](https://www.quantumcoalition.io/).

Our team is spread across various disciplines in quantum computing, and are split
into three subteams: Hardware, Theory, and Algorithms.  Each team hosts its own
weekly meetings and works on projects.
